Material Design is a design language developed in 2014 by Google and is very popular for web and mobile applications.

Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and ink.

With the components from the Material-UI library it’s very easy to make use of Material Design elements in your React web or mobile application. The library’s website can be found at:[https://material-ui.com](https://material-ui.com).
